<h1>Sustainability Initiatives in Schools</h1>

<section>
    <h2>1. Educational Importance</h2>
    <p>
        Sustainability is no longer a niche subject but a fundamental competence for the 21st century. 
        Schools have a responsibility to prepare students for real-world challenges such as climate change, 
        resource scarcity, and social responsibility.

        <li>Encourage responsible decision-making by helping students understand the impact of their everyday actions</li>
        <li>Support global citizenship and prepare students for future academic and professional environments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Importance of Reducing Food Waste</h2>
    <p>
        Food waste is a major global and local issue with environmental, economic, and social consequences.
        A policy that bans unnecessary disposal of edible food and promotes donation has clear benefits.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reduces environmental footprint and greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Teaches responsible resource management</li>
        <li>Addresses social inequality by supporting people in need</li>
        <li>Models ethical and sustainable institutional behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Educational Value and Student Development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hands-on learning about supply chains, consumption, and social justice</li>
        <li>Encourages student leadership in organizing donation systems</li>
        <li>Strengthens empathy and social responsibility</li>
        <li>Promotes mindful consumption habits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Appreciation and School Culture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Students value food more by recognizing its importance to others</li>
        <li>Develop pride in contributing to community support</li>
        <li>Build shared purpose within the school</li>
        <li>Foster gratitude and ethical awareness</li>
    </ul>

        This appreciation often leads to long-term behavioral change beyond school.
